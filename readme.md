# Movie Recommendation Systems 

This repository contains two movie recommendation systems developed using the [MovieLens 100K dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It includes both traditional user-based collaborative filtering and a deep learning-based neural collaborative filtering model.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the Dataset

Download the [MovieLens 100K dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) and place the extracted `ml-100k` folder in the project root:

```
project/
├── ml-100k/
│   ├── u.data
│   ├── u.item
│   ├── u.user
│   ├── u.genre
├── rs1.py
├── rs2.py
├── run_eval.py
├── eda.ipynb
└── README.md
```

## How to Run

When both models are first run, it takes some time for them to train. After that, they are stored as a pickle model, which can later be used without training.

### RS1: User-Based Collaborative Filtering
```bash
python rs1.py
```
- Computes cosine similarity between users
- Uses top-K nearest neighbors for prediction
- Prompts user input and returns top 10 movie recommendations

### RS2: Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
```bash
python rs2.py
```
- Trains a PyTorch model with user/movie embeddings and MLP layers
- Saves best model based on RMSE
- Recommends top 10 movies based on learned user preferences

---

## Evaluation

Run the following to compare the two systems:
```bash
python run_eval.py --num_users 10
```

Metrics evaluated:
- **RMSE**: Accuracy of predicted ratings
- **Novelty**: Encourages recommendations beyond the most popular items

---

## Models Used

### RS1
- Collaborative filtering with cosine similarity
- Dynamic K-selection for neighbors

### RS2
- Neural network with embedding layers for users and items
- Hidden layers with dropout, batch normalization, and LeakyReLU

---

## EDA

The `eda.ipynb` notebook includes:
- Distribution of ratings
- User/movie interaction statistics
- Insights on data sparsity

---

## Demo

Once a model is trained, the system interactively asks for a `user_id`:
```
Enter User ID to get recommendations:
```
And returns:
```
Top 10 recommended movies for User X:
1. Movie A
2. Movie B
...
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- torch, torchvision (for RS2)

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
